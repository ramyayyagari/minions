# Where On-Device and Cloud LLMs Meet

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-7289DA?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/jfJyxXwFVa)

_What is this?_ Minions is a communication protocol that enables small on-device models to collaborate with frontier models in the cloud. By only reading long contexts locally, we can reduce cloud costs with minimal or no quality degradation. This repository provides a demonstration of the protocol. Get started below or see our paper and blogpost below for more information.

Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15964)

## Setup

_We have tested the following setup on Mac and Ubuntu with Python 3.10-3.11_ (Note: Python 3.13 is not supported)

<details>
  <summary>Optional: Create a virtual environment with your favorite package manager (e.g. conda, venv, uv)</summary>
        
  ```python
  conda create -n minions python=3.11
  ```
</details><br>

**Step 1:** Clone the repository and install the Python package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HazyResearch/minions.git
cd minions
pip install -e .  # installs the minions package in editable mode
```

_note_: for optional MLX-LM install the package with the following command:

```bash
pip install -e ".[mlx]"
```

_note_: for optional Cartesia-MLX install, pip install the basic package and then follow the instructions below.

**Step 2:** Install a server for running the local model.

We support two servers for running local models: `ollama` and `tokasaurus`. You need to install at least one of these.

- You should use `ollama` if you do not have access to NVIDIA GPUs. Install `ollama` following the instructions [here](https://ollama.com/download). To enable Flash Attention, run
  `launchctl setenv OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION 1` and, if on a mac, restart the ollama app.
- You should use `tokasaurus` if you have access to NVIDIA GPUs and you are running the Minions protocol, which benefits from the high-throughput of `tokasaurus`. Install `tokasaurus` with the following command:

```
uv pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ tokasaurus==0.0.1.post1
```

<details>
  <summary>Optional: Install Cartesia-MLX (only available on Apple Silicon)</summary>

1. Download XCode
2. Install the command line tools by running `xcode-select --install`
3. Install the NanobindðŸ§®

```
pip install nanobind@git+https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind.git@2f04eac452a6d9142dedb957701bdb20125561e4
```

4. Install the Cartesia Metal backend by running the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cartesia-ai/edge.git#subdirectory=cartesia-metal
```

5. Install the Cartesia-MLX package by running the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cartesia-ai/edge.git#subdirectory=cartesia-mlx
```

</details><br>

**Step 3:** Set your API key for at least one of the following cloud LLM providers.

_If needed, create an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) or [TogetherAI API key](https://docs.together.ai/docs/quickstart) for the cloud model._

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
export TOGETHER_API_KEY=<your-together-api-key>
```

## Minions Demo Application

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/70Kot0_DFNs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Kot0_DFNs)

To try the Minion or Minions protocol, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If you are seeing an error about the `ollama` client,

```
An error occurred: Failed to connect to Ollama. Please check that Ollama is downloaded, running and accessible. https://ollama.com/download
```

try running the following command:

```bash
OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 ollama serve
```

## Example code: Minion (singular)

The following example is for an `ollama` local client and an `openai` remote client.
The protocol is `minion`.

```python
from minions.clients.ollama import OllamaClient
from minions.clients.openai import OpenAIClient
from minions.minion import Minion

local_client = OllamaClient(
        model_name="llama3.2",
    )

remote_client = OpenAIClient(
        model_name="gpt-4o",
    )

# Instantiate the Minion object with both clients
minion = Minion(local_client, remote_client)


context = """
Patient John Doe is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension. In his latest checkup, his blood pressure was recorded at 160/100 mmHg, and he reported occasional chest discomfort during physical activity.
Recent laboratory results show that his LDL cholesterol level is elevated at 170 mg/dL, while his HDL remains within the normal range at 45 mg/dL. Other metabolic indicators, including fasting glucose and renal function, are unremarkable.
"""

task = "Based on the patient's blood pressure and LDL cholesterol readings in the context, evaluate whether these factors together suggest an increased risk for cardiovascular complications."

# Execute the minion protocol for up to two communication rounds
output = minion(
    task=task,
    context=[context],
    max_rounds=2
)
```

## Example Code: Minions (plural)

The following example is for an `ollama` local client and an `openai` remote client.
The protocol is `minions`.

```python
from minions.clients.ollama import OllamaClient
from minions.clients.openai import OpenAIClient
from minions.minions import Minions
from pydantic import BaseModel

class StructuredLocalOutput(BaseModel):
    explanation: str
    citation: str | None
    answer: str | None

local_client = OllamaClient(
        model_name="llama3.2",
        temperature=0.0,
        structured_output_schema=StructuredLocalOutput
)

remote_client = OpenAIClient(
        model_name="gpt-4o",
)


# Instantiate the Minion object with both clients
minion = Minions(local_client, remote_client)


context = """
Patient John Doe is a 60-year-old male with a history of hypertension. In his latest checkup, his blood pressure was recorded at 160/100 mmHg, and he reported occasional chest discomfort during physical activity.
Recent laboratory results show that his LDL cholesterol level is elevated at 170 mg/dL, while his HDL remains within the normal range at 45 mg/dL. Other metabolic indicators, including fasting glucose and renal function, are unremarkable.
"""

task = "Based on the patient's blood pressure and LDL cholesterol readings in the context, evaluate whether these factors together suggest an increased risk for cardiovascular complications."

# Execute the minion protocol for up to two communication rounds
output = minion(
    task=task,
    doc_metadata="Medical Report",
    context=[context],
    max_rounds=2
)
```

## Python Notebook

To run Minion/Minions in a notebook, checkout `minions.ipynb`.

## CLI

To run Minion/Minions in a CLI, checkout `minions_cli.py`.

Set your choice of local and remote models by running the following command. The format is `<provider>/<model_name>`. Choice of providers are `ollama`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `together`, `perplexity`, `openrouter`, `groq`, and `mlx`.

```bash
export MINIONS_LOCAL=ollama/llama3.2
export MINIONS_REMOTE=openai/gpt-4o
```

```bash
minions --help
```

```bash
minions --context <path_to_context> --protocol <minion|minions>
```

## Miscellaneous Setup

### Using Azure OpenAI with Minions

#### Set Environment Variables
```bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
```

#### Example Code
Here's an example of how to use Azure OpenAI with the Minions protocol in your own code:

```python
from minions.clients.ollama import OllamaClient
from minions.clients.azure_openai import AzureOpenAIClient
from minions.minion import Minion

local_client = OllamaClient(
    model_name="llama3.2",
)

remote_client = AzureOpenAIClient(
    model_name="gpt-4o",  # This should match your deployment name
    api_key="your-api-key",
    azure_endpoint="https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/",
    api_version="2024-02-15-preview",
)

# Instantiate the Minion object with both clients
minion = Minion(local_client, remote_client)
```
